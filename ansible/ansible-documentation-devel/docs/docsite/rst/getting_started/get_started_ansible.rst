*****************************
Start automating with Ansible
*****************************

Get started with Ansible by creating an automation project, building an inventory, and creating a "Hello World" playbook.

#. Install Ansible.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install ansible

#. Create a project folder on your filesystem.

   .. code-block:: bash

      mkdir ansible_quickstart && cd ansible_quickstart

   Using a single directory structure makes it easier to add to source control as well as to reuse and share automation content.

Continue getting started with Ansible by :ref:`building an inventory<get_started_inventory>`.
