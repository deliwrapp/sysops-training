# How to contribute to kubernetes-engine-samples

## Steps to follow

1. [Submit an issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/issues/new) describing your proposed changes.
1. Wait for the proposed changes to be accepted by a repo maintainer.
1. Sign a [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement-cla) if you haven't done so.
1. Fork the repo, develop, and test your code changes.
1. Ensure that your code follows [samples requirements](#samples-requirements).
1. Create a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/compare).

Note that:
- The PR reviewer may not be looking at the correctness of the code. They are
  generally focusing on the PR structure and that it follows samples requirements.
- You are responsible for making prompt fixes to any issues arising with your samples. If a sample
  goes out-of-date or breaks, it may be deprecated, depending on business needs.

## Samples requirements

All new code samples require the following:
- **Directory** for all files of the sample (e.g. `/databases/mysql-on-gke/**`).
  - Use one of the pre-existing top-level topic directories, if possible.
- **README file** with a link pointing to the tutorial or content using the sample.
  [[Template](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/blob/main/.github/new-samples-templates/README.md)]
  - There should only be one source of truth for sample instructions (i.e. don't duplicate
    instructions in the README that are or will be made available elsewhere).
- **Code** that has been tested end-to-end and follows the [Google style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).
- **GitHub Action workflow** that tests the sample code. At minimum, this should
  dry-run any container images or Terraform scripts and pass without any errors.
  [[Template](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/blob/main/.github/new-samples-templates/workflow.yml)]
  - Each container image should build successfully (e.g. `docker build...`).
  - Each Terraform script should validate successfully (e.g. `terraform validate...`).
  - If there are any other quick tests that can be performed, they should also be added here.
- **Dependencies** using up-to-date versions.
  - Note that we have automation in place to update these versions on a weekly-basis.
- **License headers** on all source code and manifest files.
  [[Example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/blob/main/.github/new-samples-templates/cloudbuild.yaml#L1-L13)]
- **Region tags** surrounding any file or snippets of code that will be embeded in a tutorial.
  [[Example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/blob/main/ai-ml/llm-multiple-gpus/llm-service.yaml#L15-L28)]
  - These surround code to be embeded and look like: `[START gke_topic_sample_title_file_name]` and
    `[END gke_topic_sample_title_file_name]`.
- **Editable variables**, where applicable. [[Example doc](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/serve-vllm-tpu#deploy-vllm)] [[Example sample](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/blob/HEAD/ai-ml/vllm-tpu/vllm-llama3-70b.yaml#L42)]
  - Samples from this repository that are embedded in cloud.google.com documentation can be configured to include editable variables. In other words, readers should be able edit variables such as `PROJECT_ID` on the cloud.google.com page itself.
  -  To enable editable variables, ensure that your variables
      -  use all-caps (for example, `project_id` should be `PROJECT_ID`),
      -  are underscore-delimited (for example, `PROJECT-ID` shoud be `PROJECT_ID`),
      -  and don't have special characters wrapping them (for example, `[PROJECT_ID]` should be `PROJECT_ID`).
- **CODEOWNERS file** with an entry listing the samples maintainers.
  [[CODEOWNERS](/.github/CODEOWNERS)]

### Canonical container images
- If the sample relies on canonical image artifacts, these can be hosted officially, which requires:
  - **Cloud Build configs** for all container images that pushes to the `google-samples` artifact registry.
  [[Template](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/blob/main/.github/new-samples-templates/cloudbuild.yaml)]
  - **A Terraform resource** for the above Cloud Build configs.
  [[Example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes-engine-samples/blob/main/.github/terraform/google-cloud-build-triggers.tf#L194-L207)]
    - Note that in order for the Cloud Build configs to be applied to the
      `google-samples` project, you need to run `terraform init && terraform apply`
      while in that project (a repository admin will do this for you). [[Docs](/.github/terraform/README.md)]
    - The images will be of the form `us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke<image_name>:latest`
